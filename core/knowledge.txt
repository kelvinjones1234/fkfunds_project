- CGPA 3.50 - 4.00: Distinction
- CGPA 3.00 - 3.49: Upper Credit
- CGPA 2.50 - 2.99: Lower Credit
- CGPA 2.00 - 2.49: Pass
- CGPA 0.00 - 1.99: Fail

Carryover:
A student who fails a course in any semester will be allowed to carry the course over to the next semester if it is offered that semester. If the course is not offered, the student will still be allowed to carry it on until the course is available. A student is limited to a maximum period of eight semesters for either National Diploma or Higher National Diploma after first registration for full-time programs and 10 semesters for part-time programs.

Academic Standard:
In the first semester, if a student's GPA is less than 0.5 or he/she fails more than 70% of the course units registered for, he or she stands withdrawn. From the second semester, if a student's GPA is less than 1.5 and the CGPA is less than 1.0, such student stands withdrawn. Students with a GPA of 0.5 but less than 2.0 are on warning.
Grading System for ND & HND:
- Distinction: 75% and above
- Upper Credit: 70% - 74%
- Lower Credit: 65% - 69%
- Pass: 60% - 64%
- Fail: Below 40%

GPA Computation:
For example, if a student has the following grades:
- LAD 101: B (3.0 GPA, 3 credits) 
- SBM 121: B (3.0 GPA, 3 credits) 
- MSD 111: C (2.0 GPA, 3 credits)
The GPA can be calculated as follows: (Sum of grade points) / (Total credit units)
Make-Up Test Procedure:
If a student misses a test, they should apply to the Head of Department with a reason. If traveling, fill out an exit form approved by Student Affairs. If sick, provide a medical report from a recognized hospital.
